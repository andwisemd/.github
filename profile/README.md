# Welcome to Andwise!

At Andwise, our mission is to enable physicians to make the most of their careers and take control of their financial future. To this end, we are committed to the development of open source software that empowers physicians, and making it available for free to the entire community of healthcare professionals.

Physicians are invited to [join the waitlist](https://joinandwise.com/).

Here's some of the stuff we're working on:

* Comprehensive contract intelligence so you can make decisions based on a comprehensive and easy-to-understand summary and analysis of your contract in just minutes
* Personalized financial education tailored to your specific financial situation so you can make smart decisions with your finances
* Data insights so you can have real-time access to insights and analytics
* A directory of physician-specialized legal and financial professionals specialized in the needs of physicians

We believe that open source development is a powerful tool for enabling the healthcare industry to keep up with advances in technology and improving patient care. Andwise provides the financial and technical resources to fund open source development for these and other initiatives.
